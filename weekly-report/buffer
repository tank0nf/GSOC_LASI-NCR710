Got to work on implementing the LASI Network Cards Missing sections:
These consist of:

CmdDump
CmdDiagnose
CU_Suspend
CU, RU state tarnsition handling
TDR
Frame Processing Options errors in logic
Monitor Mode: Linux driver side
Self Test
Interrupt bits
Full Duplex Operation

The docs describes 3 address mode:
- 82586 mode
- 32-bit Segmented mode
- Linear mode
This would need significant restructureing of the current device model implementation (Helge mentioned good to have, but not necessary)


The Flexible and Simplified mode for both transmit and receive operations
Chaining buffer implementation for TX and RX
Error Statisics implementation


## Interrupt Handling

## Configuration and Options
16. **Promiscuous Mode Handling**:
    
    - Limited implementation of promiscuous mode options
17. **Full Duplex Operation**:
    
    - No explicit support for full duplex configuration

## Bus Interface Features

18. **Bus Throttle Timers**:
    
    - Bus throttle timer functionality is declared but not fully implemented
    - These control the 82596's bus usage to improve system performance
19. **Big Endian vs. Little Endian Handling**:
    
    - QEMU implementation has endianness handling code, but it's not comprehensive
    - Documentation describes specific handling requirements for big endian systems

## Core Architecture Features

20. **FIFO Buffer Management**:
    
    - No implementation of the 128-byte RX FIFO and 64-byte TX FIFO
    - These are mentioned in documentation as important for performance
21. **Action Commands Synchronization**:
    
    - Asynchronous command handling not fully implemented
    - Linux driver shows careful handling of command synchronization

## Other Issues

23. **Error Recovery Mechanisms**:
    
    - Limited implementation of recovery from error conditions
    - Linux driver shows more robust handling of errors and recovery
24. **Documentation References**:
    
    - Several "FIXME" and "TODO" comments throughout the code
    - These indicate known issues that need to be addressed
