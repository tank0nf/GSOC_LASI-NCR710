# This is an Executive Summary of the current project progress report.

Currently most of the missing features according to my analysis of LASI's 82596CA NIC has been documented in the proposal.
I think I have covered most of the features present in the documentation.
Most of the implementation so far has been without any hiccups, except for getting LASI to work on HPUX OS.
From my understanding its the only prevailing pain point for our project that needs to be properly addressed.
